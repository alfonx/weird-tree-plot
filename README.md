# WeirdTreePlot, an Graph Plotter for weird graphs
This tool was originally an attempt, to create a "map" of the whole Wikipedia, which one can hang up it's wall. It turned out to be useful as a graph plotter for somewhat special trees.

# Do I need it?
You might like it, if your tree has
* several 100k nodes.
* different node sizes with about 10 orders of magnitude between.
* very large amounts of children on one node, like 100k.

Also it should be okay for you, that
* plots could need about a few hours.
* connected nodes won't be necessarily drawn next to each other. It's about the big picture.
* edges won't be drawn. WeirdTreePlot is more about an artistical view on data. 
* there are some restrictions about layout possibilities, input and output format.

Without this file, you can't do anything. It is just too big for GitHub.
